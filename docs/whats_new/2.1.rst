What's New in Photutils 2.1?
****************************

Here we highlight some of the new functionality of the 2.1 release.
In addition to these changes, Photutils 2.1 includes several
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.


Aperture Photometry Output Table
--------------------------------

The ``aperture_photometry`` output table will now include a
``sky_center`` column if ``wcs`` is input, even if the input aperture is
not a sky aperture.


Find Peaks Border Width
-----------------------

The ``find_peaks`` ``border_width`` keyword can now accept two values,
indicating the border width along the the y and x edges, respectively.


Gini Coefficient
----------------

An optional ``mask`` keyword was added to the ``gini`` function to allow
for the exclusion of certain pixels from the calculation of the Gini
coefficient.

Also, the ``gini`` function now returns zero instead of NaN if the
(unmasked) data values sum to zero.


Improved GriddedPSFModel Plots
------------------------------

The ``'viridis'`` color map is now the default in the
``GriddedPSFModel`` ``plot_grid`` method when ``deltas=True``.

Also, the ``GriddedPSFModel`` ``plot_grid`` color bar now matches the
height of the displayed image.
