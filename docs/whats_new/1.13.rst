What's New in Photutils 1.13?
*****************************

Here we highlight some of the new functionality of the 1.13 release.
In addition to these changes, Photutils 1.13 includes a large number
of smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.


Testing the installed version of Photutils
==========================================

To test your installed version of Photutils, you can run the test suite
using the `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ command.
Running the test suite requires installing the `pytest-astropy
<https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy>`_ (0.11 or later) package.

To run the test suite, use the following command::

    pytest --pyargs photutils

This method replaces the old method of running the test suite using the
``photutils.test()`` Python function, which has been removed.


Other changes
=============

Please see the :ref:`changelog` for the complete list of changes.
